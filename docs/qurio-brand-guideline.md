# Brand Identity Guidelines: Qurio

## 1. Brand Core

### Mission Statement
> To empower developers by creating a unified, local-first **curated knowledge base** for AI agents, eliminating context fragmentation and hallucinations through the retrieval of grounded, **team-selected** documentation.

### Vision Statement
> To become the standard operating system for context—where every AI agent and developer has instant access to **specific, vetted** knowledge they need to build software without friction.

### Core Values
*   **Privacy First**: We believe your documentation and data belong on your machine. We build for `localhost` by default, ensuring no proprietary knowledge ever leaves your network without permission.
*   **Precision & Grounding**: We prioritize accuracy over speed. We don't guess; we retrieve. We provide the "ground truth" to prevent AI hallucinations.
*   **Open Standards**: We build on open protocols (MCP) and open-source foundations (PostgreSQL, Weaviate), ensuring interoperability and preventing vendor lock-in.
*   **Developer Efficiency**: We respect the flow state. Our tools are designed to be set up in minutes (`docker-compose up`) and respond in milliseconds, minimizing friction and context switching.

### Value Proposition
Qurio is the open-source **knowledge engine** for your AI coding assistants. Unlike cloud-based RAG solutions that introduce latency and privacy risks, Qurio runs locally to ingest your **handpicked** heterogeneous documentation (enterprise or public) and serve it directly to your IDE via standard protocols, ensuring your AI writes better code faster using only the **context you trust**.

## 2. Brand Personality

### Brand Archetype
**The Sage**
Qurio seeks the truth. It is the librarian of your technical knowledge, the keeper of context. It organizes chaos into structured wisdom. It is intelligent, analytical, and reliable. It doesn't dazzle with magic; it impresses with accuracy and depth of understanding.

### Voice & Tone
*   **Voice**: Technical, Precise, Concise, Reliable. We speak "Developer." We avoid marketing fluff and focus on specs, metrics, and architecture.
*   **Tone**:
    *   *In Documentation*: Clear, instructional, and structured.
    *   *In Interface*: Efficient and informative.
    *   *In Marketing*: Confident and grounded in reality.

**Do's and Don'ts:**
*   ✅ **Do**: Use precise technical terminology (e.g., "Vector Embeddings," "MCP Endpoint," "Latency p95").
*   ✅ **Do**: Focus on utility and speed (e.g., "Deploy in 5 minutes").
*   ❌ **Don't**: Use vague buzzwords like "Unleash the power" or "Magic."
*   ❌ **Don't**: Be overly casual or use slang that undermines technical authority.

## 3. Visual Identity

### Logo Concept (Guidance)
*   **Concept**: Combining elements of a "Network/Node" with a "Search/Lens" or "Library/Book."
*   **Style**: Geometric, sharp lines, scalable for favicon/terminal usage.

### Color Palette

#### Primary Colors
*   **Void Black**: Hex `#0F172A`
    *   *Usage*: Backgrounds, terminal windows, primary UI containers. Reflects the "Dark Mode" native environment of developers.
*   **Cognitive Blue**: Hex `#3B82F6`
    *   *Usage*: Primary buttons, active states, links. Represents intelligence and clarity.

#### Secondary Colors
*   **Grounded Green**: Hex `#10B981`
    *   *Usage*: Success states, "Grounded" verification indicators, high confidence scores.
*   **Context Gray**: Hex `#64748B`
    *   *Usage*: Secondary text, borders, inactive icons.

### Typography

#### Primary Typeface: **Inter** (or similar Grotesque Sans)
*   **Usage**: Headlines, UI Labels, Marketing Copy.
*   **Weights**: Bold (700) for Headers, Medium (500) for UI.
*   **Why**: Highly legible, modern, and neutral.

#### Secondary Typeface: **JetBrains Mono** (or Fira Code)
*   **Usage**: Code snippets, path names, JSON responses, technical data.
*   **Weights**: Regular (400).
*   **Why**: The native font of our user persona; implies code-first functionality.

## 4. Imagery & Style

### Photography & Graphic Style
*   **Technical Screenshots**: High-fidelity captures of the Admin UI and Terminal outputs. No generic stock photos of "people using computers."
*   **Data Visualization**: Abstract representations of nodes, vectors, and connections. Clean lines, glowing nodes on dark backgrounds.
*   **Schematic Diagrams**: Architecture diagrams showing the flow of data from Ingestion -> Embedding -> Retrieval.

### Iconography
*   **Style**: "Feather" or "Phosphor" style icons. Thin stroke (1.5px or 2px), rounded corners, consistent geometry.
*   **Key Metaphors**: Database cylinders, Search magnifying glasses, Network nodes, Code brackets `< >`, Library stacks.
