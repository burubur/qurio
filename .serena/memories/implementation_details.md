- **App Architecture:** Refactored `apps/backend/internal/app` to use Dependency Injection with interfaces (`Database`, `VectorStore`, `TaskPublisher`).
- **Bootstrap Logic:** Decoupled `main.go` by moving infrastructure initialization (DB, Migrations, Weaviate, NSQ Producer) to `apps/backend/internal/app/bootstrap.go`. This improves testability and separates concerns.
- **Testability:**
    - Created `mocks_test.go` in `app` package.
    - Updated `app.New` to accept interfaces, allowing unit testing with mocks (using `sqlmock` for DB).
    - `main.go` now acts as the Composition Root, initializing concrete adapters (`wstore.NewStore`, `nsq.NewProducer`) and passing them to `app.New`.
    - Added deep testing for `ResultConsumer` (handling invalid JSON, dependency errors).
    - Implemented table-driven tests for MCP `Handler` covering all tool invocations.
    - Added network error simulation tests for `Weaviate` adapter.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Updated `source` and `job` handlers to explicitly check for `sql.ErrNoRows` and return `404 Not Found` (HTTP 404) with `NOT_FOUND` error code in JSON envelope.
    - `source.Repository.SoftDelete` now checks `RowsAffected` to correctly report if a record was not found (returns `sql.ErrNoRows`).
