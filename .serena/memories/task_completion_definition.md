The user requested a Technical Implementation Plan for the Qurio MVP based on `docs/2025-12-21-qurio-mvp.md`.
I have:
1.  Analyzed the codebase and requirements.
2.  Performed RAG searches for "Go web crawler", "Weaviate hybrid search", "Pinia setup", etc.
3.  Generated a detailed plan at `docs/plans/2025-12-21-qurio-mvp-implementation.md`.
4.  Updated `implementation_details` and `project_overview` memories.

The next step is for the developer (or Agent) to execute the plan starting with Task 1.
